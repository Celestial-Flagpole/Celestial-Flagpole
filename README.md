# Floatie

> Floatie is a floating browser window that you can stick anywhere on your screen to watch movies, tutorial videos or even read files from your local system. As developers ourselves, we watch a ton of youtube videos and tutorials and code along side. But we got tired of trying to squeeze the browser window into one corner and our text editor into another. This floating screen helps us watch our tutorials and code at the same time, with a lot more screen space.
